Do I email my doctors? Would be even better if, since it's already authenticated with other services, the system would automatically send the link/QR code.",5,An overview of all of my previous tests,New/unread reports,"I'd like to see some seal of endorsement from my provider(s), or an icon/badge showing that this service is secure.",Yes,No,No,4,Yes,5
8/29/2025 10:32:20,Yes,Yes,4,A conglomirate of all the care apps mentioned in prior question,Patients or admins who want to consolidate all heath care ,I could log in once and be able to use any of my doctor apps,"Yes, it's great! I've been waiting for this",so far no but i need to use it extensively and see if any sync errors,4,All i need at the moment! Honestly :),"Active Meds - ones I have active prescriptions on and refills; would be good to know how many refills left and frequent there // Recent labs - labs done in last 30 -60 days; Upcoming - activity - appts, blood work and confirmed appointments that doc and I have on our calendars","maybe refills, med details, labs over time and suggestions of which labs to test which have been a while",Yes,Maybe doc name who sent for the lab,If i use this I would be able to tell you - may need to use for 14-30 days. ,4,"Yes, maybe it can show ie groupings of all my labs from all various providers in one section, or list history of my appts and doctor - table format. ",4
8/29/2025 11:55:12,No,Yes,5,Managing all your health portals in one place and possibly also all the health portals for your family like children or partners ,"Parents are my first thought of who would benefit. Then second would be someone managing an at-risk person's health like an aging parent & adult child, a sick adult & their partner or a guardian/sick adult that can't manage their own health","I would have to add all my portals then would be able to see everything (appointments, medications, etc.) in one central place","Yes! It was well structured, there wasn't too much on each page and the steps felt like they were in the right order","Why would I want to share a link or generate a QR code right away? I don't know why I would need that asap, but maybe that could be in the intro to the system after I set up",3,A cohesive dashboard of all my recent health data that has been connected in,"Medication - what I'm taking now
Recent labs - unread lab results that are waiting for me or a doctor to review
upcoming visits - planned dr office visits
shared records - number of records I have shared ","Any messages pending from my portals. MyChart shows a clear alert for notes from my doctor or things like upcoming medical needs (yearly appointments, expired vaccines, etc.)","I'm missing messages, but I like the ""last updated"" note because I know this is recent and may have changed ",Upcoming activity - I would expect what's next to be more important than recent activity? Might just be personal preference though to plan for what's next then see what's already happened,1. Message a provider and 2. request an appointment,5,"Yes, I like the way it's all integrated but I would want a ""here's how we keep your info secure"" message somewhere along the set up. I may have missed it when on the home page, but it should be repeated when signing up to establish trust with the app",4
8/29/2025 12:35:55,Yes,No,4,Consolidating healthcare records from multiple providers,Myself or family members,Receive welcome emails and app download,"Likely, pressed the button for provider and saw records/data","(note: performed the app on onboarding from mobile and wasn't able to simultaneously answer questions whilst performing the experience) 

More of a demo logistics question: Was I supposed to create a faux account or use the demo account? 

When I tapped on Sarah Thompson demo account I was expecting to see a demo (but didn't). So I assumed I was creating a new faux account. After proceeding to add an ""existing"" health record I saw my account was Sarah Thompson",4,Various systems which may host healthcare records,Health records and results ,"Upcoming (annual) doctor or check up visits or shots to schedule, maybe Rx pick up and location",I didn't get to try - would have like to retrieve doctor notes from a previous visit,I'd have to go back to the app to see the dashboard to provide this feedback,None comes up to mind at the moment ,3,"A single pane of glass tracking all the health related records helps me make more confident real time decisions vs context switching into different systems to see if I missed data

Ease of pulling records from different systems was great",4
8/29/2025 15:20:43,Yes,Yes,5,Coordinating and aggregating my health information in one location,Everyone - or at least anyone comfortable with using Apps,"I would be able to log into this app, see all the information related to my health, medications and upcoming doctors appointments","Yes, the order of the steps was very intuitive. I appreciate the simplicity and landing on the dashboard of my health results and upcoming activities","I understand that the initial buttons were simulation, and possibly it would be a place where typical connections would default - but you might consider just having people select from a drop down to create their connections - whether doctor or pharmacy or lab locations. It doesnt feel as invasive as I have felt other doctor type apps or websites feel.",5,"It looks like this dashboard is showing me a comprehensive tally of all of my recent health related instances. Whether doc appts, lab results, prescriptions, etc. I wonder if there might also be a place to track overall symptoms? That then could be sent to the doctor ahead of time? Maybe if someone wanted to keep track of correspondence with their doctor - one of the areas could be symptom tracking or a way to document my status as a patient.","I feel that as long as the app is connected with my pharmacy/doctor, then my active medications would be what I am currently taking as part of my overall health picture. Recent labs would be the results of my lab results. I would hope that it would be since the last few years given I dont get lab work done very often, but I would like to be able to see my lab work back a few years to compare or to share with my doctor in case I see a different doctor than who prescribed my lab tests.","Only thing is a kind of symptom tracker. Maybe how I feel after I have been on medications or how I feel after receiving other types of treatment. Maybe it could be a way that I could share those results with my doctor, in case the results are not what the doctor had in mind.","Yes. Assuming the links would open when I click on the summary ribbon at the top of the page. I like the summarized view, and it would be a place I would want to come initially when I log in. That way I can go to exactly where I want depending on what is pending or what I am expecting to come in whether its lab results or doc notes. ",No. It is very intuitive. ,Maybe chat with a medical professional if I had just generic questions about my lab or doc visit results. Or a guide to understand acronyms or ranges appropriate for my gender and age. Most people dont understand how to read charts and results - and it would be great to have someone (or something) help translate for people.,5,"Yes, assuming that its being fed directly from the sources. Health information requires a sense of urgency. Everyone is looking for data and information at their fingertips - so to have something fed directly from the source provides a level of ownership of the data and some control over how it is consumed.",5
